# ripcord-api

The working project name is `Communicaton Security is Mandatory`.

This project endeavors to reverse engineer as much of the unreleased Discord Client API as possible, and produce a library of functions that lets programmers:

 - Write a better, more fully featured, and open source Discord client.
 - Write bots which can respond to voice commands.
 - Implement optional E2EE in a Discord Client.
